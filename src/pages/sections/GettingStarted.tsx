          BootWind is a modern, utility-first CSS framework designed to help developers quickly build beautiful, responsive user interfaces.
          Inspired by Tailwind CSS, BootWind focuses on providing a clean and customizable utility set that works right out of the box. Whether you're building a personal project, a full-fledged web application, or just experimenting with new ideas, BootWind has the flexibility to grow with your needs.

          The core philosophy behind BootWind is to give you full control over your layout and design without having to write custom CSS for every component. With utilities that span from spacing and typography to colors and shadows, you can style your elements directly in your markup and focus on creating functionality rather than wasting time tweaking styles.

The utility-first approach promotes code clarity and reusability, making your projects easier to maintain.

        <pre className="p-4 rounded-lg overflow-x-auto shadow-lg bg-gray-100">
          <code className="text-sm text-gray-800">
            {'<button class="bg-primary text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-md hover:bg-primary-dark">\n  Click Me\n</button>'}
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
          This button will have a primary background color, white text, padding, rounded corners, and a hover effect.
        </p>
      </section>
    </div>
